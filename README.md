**Question 1**: Assignment Submission, how to submit assignments for grading using the Blackboard LMS.

If you do all your coding assignments for a specific chapter or submission, you can have each file (images, CSS, HTML, JS, etc, all the files from the chapter datasets provided by Cengage and the files you need to edit) in a single folder (name_chapter/tutorial_number) with all your files or having each specific part of an assignment in a separate folder (e.g. name_and_number_of_assignment)
